      quote:  I came to the sessions hoping for some guidance on my professional life and left with a framework to both improve it and my personal life also. Through a number of the conversations, we were able to establish a framework for improving some problem areas which has inspired a confidence I previously didn't know I was lacking. These sessions have provided some of the largest impact, well beyond anything I had hoped for going in, and I couldnâ€™t speak highly enough of how much Dave has helped me.
