      quote:  I came to the sessions hoping for some guidance on my professional life and left with a framework to both improve it and my personal life also. Through a number of the conversations, we were able to establish a framework for improving some problem areas which has inspired a confidence I previously didn't know I was lacking. These sessions have provided some of the largest impact, well beyond anything I had hoped for going in, and I couldnâ€™t speak highly enough of how much Dave has helped me.

      quote: I got tremendous value from my coaching sessions with Dave. It was very clear to me from the start that he was there to listen and understand what my specific goals were, and what I was trying to get from the program. Dave did not take a prescriptive route, but instead guided me towards things that he felt would help me in my journey. The sessions gave me both the professional guidance I was looking for, as well as meaningful insights into leadership styles that were additive to my own perspectives.
