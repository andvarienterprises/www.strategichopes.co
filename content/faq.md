### What is Coaching? What should I expect?

These are covered in [Dave's Coaching Approach](/coachingapproach) and [What to Expect](/whattoexpect) - I'm hoping those pages continue to cover most FAQs, so if they seem incomplete to you, please let me know.

### What Qualifies you to be a Coach?

As I mention in [Dave's Coaching Approach](/coachingapproach), there are no real qualifying attributes to call yourself a coach.

However, I believe the following mean that I'll be an effective coach for many folks who might be interested:

  - 15+ years in management and executive leadership in tech, taking a coaching approach to both.
  - Qualified with Distinction in Professional Disploma in Coaching and Mentoring with [Kingstown College](https://www.kingstowncollege.ie/).
  - [ICF](https://www.coachingfederation.org/) and [EMCC](https://www.emccglobal.org/) member.
    - The above Diploma qualification (or similar) is a pre-requisite for membership.
    - I am bound by the codes of ethics of both bodies in my practice.

### Will Coaching help with Career progression?

Probably. Everyone is able to self-motivate or self-direct to an extent, and many do very well for most of their career without specific guidance. However, everyone progresses (toward career success, or happiness, or both) through the intervention of others, be it a leader, a peer, or someone sensible who has your best interests at heart and can provide another perspective. If they can get a little bit into detail and try to keep you honest on really moving toward your goals, so much the better. That is, in essence, what the coaching relationship is. 

### Do I need to be in Ireland?

Not at all! Most of my coaching engagements are managed completely remotely, and I have extensive experience working with odd timezones. If we're setting up sessions, I use [Calendly](https://www.calendly.com/) to manage those, and you can find a time that suits you.

If you do happen to be in Dublin, I am happy to meet in person, either at your office or elsewhere. Somewhere with secure parking for a motorbike and good coffee is a bonus :-)

### Is it Expensive?

I'm going to briefly overcome generations of Irish guilt and self-deprecation to mutter something about how I'm good at this and have a lot of experience, a solid track record and an array of skills and tools that are very valuable. You're getting someone with decades of experience in many different types of teams, organisations and companies. If you're in the Production Engineering/SRE/DevOps space, I also have more experience than most in the methods, tools and approaches there.

So, let's put it this way: if you're an individual paying out of pocket (and paying VAT if you're in the EU), the answer is probably yes. Drop me a line and I'll be happy to give you an idea, with no obligations.

However, I would expect the amount paid in relation to impact and outcomes to be a rounding error in the People Development budgets of most employers. So, the usual route would be for an employer to sponsor coaching for an employee that needs it. If you need advice on convincing your boss, I have a [1-pager 'brochure'](/files/daveoc-coaching-brochure-v1.0.pdf) that can also serve as a 'convincing your boss or HR department' document.

### Why 'Strategic Hopes'?

I spent about 17 years as an [SRE](https://sre.google) at Google, our semi-official motto was "hope is not a strategy". I think that's a fine motto for an engineering function that makes sure the latest disaster isn't as disastrous as it could be, due to careful planning and defense in depth.

However, humans still have hopes. They're often nebulous or partially-defined. They're often one of the things an employer is only too happy to provide if the employee doesn't bring their own. A frank discussion of where you want to be and some idea of what's next to move towards there is often an ideal outcome from coaching. If you know what you want, then the job of reconciling that with what is expected of you is closer to being under control.

So, somewhere between having your future completely mapped out, and aimlessly coasting is the sweet spot. The future doesn't always cooperate (that's the thing with the future), but you can hope for something more in line with your ideal outcome, and have as much of a strategy as suits your personality and circumstances to get there.
