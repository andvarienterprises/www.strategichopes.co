The fine gents [Guang](https://substack.com/profile/3521692-guang-yang) and [Ronak](https://substack.com/profile/3522616-ronak-nathani) over at [Software Misadventures](https://softwaremisadventures.com/) were good enough to have me as a guest, talking for far too long about Mentoring, coaching, 1:1s and some basic models for thinking about some of these things by yourself. A fun chat!

Check it out below.
