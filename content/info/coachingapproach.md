> Let's get this out of the way first: Coaching and Mentoring are unregulated industries. Anyone can say they're a life coach, executive coach, or any other kind of coach or mentor. There are professional bodies like [ICF](https://www.coachingfederation/) and [EMCC](https://www.emccglobal.org/) who support professional standards, codes of ethics and have a fairly clear picture of what Coaching in particular is. I'm a member of both, but that's neither here nor there -- the fact remains that seeking coaching for yourself, an employee or a team is very much a question of finding the right person, who's got a similar enough idea of what is needed that you're happy to work together.

> So, rather than having a "What is Coaching and Mentoring?" page where I try to capture the dry academic version of things, I have this page, where I set out what approach I take.


### What is Dave's definition of Coaching?


Coaching is a support structure for having a conversation with yourself. What that conversation is about is up to you. Some examples might be:

 - There's a change you'd like to make, but aren't sure how to get started, or have been avoiding doing it.
 - You're feeling a bit directionless; you're not sure what you want or how to get it.
 - You're dealing with a big change and trying to reconcile it with your values and what you want.

The list is endless. 

### What is Mentoring?

Mentoring is a more knowledge-based relationship, where ideally a person experienced in a certain area works with someone less experienced in that area. It's often said that the mentoring relationship only really ends once the mentee becomes a mentor themselves. In reality, these tend to be a shorter engagement than that, for getting a new employee up to speed and integrated into a new role, for example.

### Dave's Approach

In my coaching practice, I use a fairly loose hybrid coaching and mentoring model. What this means is that as well as curating a conversation where we talk about and make progress on what you're seeking coaching on, I also am able to give specific advice on how to approach certain situations, tools and methods to use in your work as a leader or engineer, and generally introduce a mentoring mindset.

This is especially true if you happen to work in engineering leadership and in reliability or SRE/DevOps -- my [background](https://log.andvari.net/pages/about.html) features many years of practical leadership experience in this space. 

### What to Expect

Firstly and above all, the engagement is driven by you. I'll describe a 'normal' engagement here, but we can tailor things to your needs.

The first step is to have what in dry academic circles we call a 'chemistry session'. This is usually 15-30 minutes where we'll have a chat, you can let me know what you're looking to achieve, and we can get a feel for how we both operate. I'll send you on some light reading, such as my coaching agreement and the codes of ethics I operate by.

If, after the chemistry session, you decide you're not feeling it; then you can let me know, and that's perfectly fine. I'd much rather that happen than someone feel like they're going through the motions or feel pressured to continue. 

If you decide you'd like to work with me, we'll schedule 4 one-hour sessions, generally long enough apart that you can try things, do some more in-depth thinking, or otherwise have enough breathing space between sessions. 2-4 weeks between sessions is fairly normal.

These sessions are generally going to be online -- although I am based in Dublin and can show up in person if you have a place you want to meet. 

The session will generally comprise a conversation where you'll do most of the talking; I'm interested in hering what you're looking to achieve or figure out, and I'm here to help, prod, cajole and gently nudge you toward selfidentification of what you could try, and where you'd like to go. I may use one of a few 'tools' I've built up, such as surveys in between sessions, or whiteboarding of ideas. For engineers, think of it as a brainstorming session just for you. The outcome is that we end up coming out of each sessions with a lot to think about, and maybe a few things we've promised to each other to do.

There are very few instances where we get to the end of a coaching engagement and the client says "Everything is fixed and I a now fine forever". Your career is a long road; coaching is there to get you back on the path that works for you, and maybe give you a few tools and tricks to do right by yourself in the future.

#### Still not sure?

I offer free "chemistry sessions" for folks, to make sure they'd like to work with me. Hit the big orange 'Get in Touch' button and...get in touch. If you're not interested in moving forward after that, there is absolutely no obligation to do so.
